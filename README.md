# Rumour-dectetion
Developing a model to detect and analyse rumour in tweets

The goal is to make a supervised rumour detection model from a sequence of tweets. The model is later apply to another dataset to perform analytics over the rumours detected.
The sequence is processed turning messages into a conversation tree. Additional features are included.

A broad range of algorithms are implemented, including BERT

A report summaricing the results is included.

## Requirements:

All the code is implemented in Python

Libraries:
- Pandas
- Pytorch with CUDA for GPU processing
- BERT hugginface implementation [!https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index]
- Jupyter
